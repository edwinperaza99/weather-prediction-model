Machine learning model to predict the weather. It leverages historical weather data to forecast future weather conditions.

## Key Notebooks

Below is an overview of the most significant notebooks:

### **`3.0-weather-prediction-models.ipynb`**

This is the primary notebook containing the core workflow for:

- Data Analysis
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploration of all models and variations
- Model training
- Model Evaluation
- Visualization of results

This notebook provides a comprehensive and detailed walkthrough of the project’s workflow

### **`4.0-simplified.ipynb`**

This notebook presents a cleaner and streamlined version of the workflow:

- The primary focus is on running the key steps efficiently.
- Exploration and detailed steps from `3.0-weather-prediction-models.ipynb` have been omitted.
- Uses modular Python code to call functions from dedicated scripts (`src/` folder), ensuring better reusability and organization.
