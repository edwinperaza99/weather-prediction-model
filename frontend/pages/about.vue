						What Does Weatheria Do<span class="text-accent">?</span>
					</h2>
				</header>
				<p class="text-content leading-relaxed">
					Weatheria predicts Earth surface temperatures using advanced machine
					learning techniques. By analyzing historical climate data, it
					forecasts global warming trends based on spatial (latitude, longitude)
					and temporal (year, month) features. The insights aim to contribute to
					a deeper understanding of climate change's impact and help build
					resilience against its effects.

						How It Was Built<span class="text-accent">.</span>
					</h2>
				</header>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-content leading-relaxed">
					<li>
						<strong>Frontend:</strong> Built using Nuxt.js with TailwindCSS for
						styling and extended with DaisyUI components for a modern,
						responsive design. The frontend is deployed on Vercel.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Backend:</strong> Hosted on Google Cloud's Virtual Machine
						(VM) and containerized using Docker for easy scalability and
						reliable deployment. The backend was developed with FastAPI,
						responsible for serving predictions from pre-trained machine
						learning models.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Machine Learning:</strong> The models were built using
						Python and the Scikit-learn library. Four algorithms were used:
						Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Regression
						(SVR), and Linear Regression. The Random Forest model achieved the
						highest accuracy with an RÂ² score of
						<span class="text-accent">0.9857</span>.

					repository, a trusted resource for historical climate data. It
					includes records of average land temperatures collected globally,
					along with metadata such as date, latitude, longitude, and uncertainty
					levels. To ensure data quality:
				</p>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-content leading-relaxed mb-4">
					<li>
						Records prior to 1870 were excluded due to data incompleteness.
					</li>
					<li>
						Missing temperature values were removed to maintain dataset
						integrity.
					</li>
					<li>
						Features such as year, month, latitude, and longitude were carefully
						extracted for model training.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-content leading-relaxed">
					These steps resulted in a clean and structured dataset, allowing the

					Four machine learning algorithms were employed to analyze the data:
					Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Regression
					(SVR), and Linear Regression. Each model was evaluated using metrics
					such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Median Absolute Error (MedAE), Mean
					Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² scores.
					Random Forest emerged as the most accurate model with an RÂ² score of
					0.9857.
