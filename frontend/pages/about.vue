					What Does Weatheria Do?
				</h2>
				<p class="text-content leading-relaxed">
					Weatheria predicts Earth surface temperatures using advanced machine
					learning techniques. By analyzing historical climate data, it
					forecasts global warming trends based on spatial (latitude, longitude)
					and temporal (year, month) features. The insights aim to contribute to
					a deeper understanding of climate change's impact and help build
					resilience against its effects.

					How It Was Built
				</h2>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-content leading-relaxed">
					<li>
						<strong>Frontend:</strong> Built with Nuxt.js and styled using
						DaisyUI for a responsive and visually engaging user interface.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Backend:</strong> Developed using FastAPI to process
						predictions by loading trained machine learning models serialized
						with Pickle.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Models include Random Forest,
						K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Linear
						Regression. The Random Forest model achieved the highest RÂ² score of
						<span class="text-accent">0.9857</span>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Deployment:</strong> Hosted on AWS using Docker for seamless
						scalability and reliability.

					Dataset and Data Handling
				</h2>
				<p class="text-content leading-relaxed mb-4">
					The dataset used in this project is sourced from the
					<a
						href="https://berkeleyearth.org/data/"
						class="text-primary hover:text-accent"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						>Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature</a
					>
					repository, a trusted resource for historical climate data. It
					includes records of average land temperatures collected globally,
					along with metadata such as date, latitude, longitude, and uncertainty
					levels. To ensure data quality:
				</p>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-content leading-relaxed mb-4">
					<li>
						Records prior to 1870 were excluded due to data incompleteness.
					</li>
					<li>
						Missing temperature values were removed to maintain dataset
						integrity.
					</li>
					<li>
						Features such as year, month, latitude, and longitude were carefully
						extracted for model training.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-content leading-relaxed">
					These steps resulted in a clean and structured dataset, allowing the
					models to effectively capture spatial and temporal patterns in global
					temperature changes.

					Machine Learning Models and Results
				</h2>
				<p class="text-content leading-relaxed mb-4">
					Four machine learning algorithms were employed to analyze the data:
					Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Regression
					(SVR), and Linear Regression. Each model was evaluated using metrics
					such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Median Absolute Error (MedAE), Mean
					Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² scores.
					Random Forest emerged as the most accurate model with an RÂ² score of
					0.9857.
